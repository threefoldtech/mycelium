      summary: Get a message from the inbound message queue
      description: |
        Get a message from the inbound message queue. By default, the message is removed from the queue and won't be shown again.
        If the peek query parameter is set to true, the message will be peeked, and the next call to this endpoint will show the same message.
        This method returns immediately by default: a message is returned if one is ready, and if there isn't nothing is returned. If the timeout
        query parameter is set, this call won't return for the given amount of seconds, unless a message is received
